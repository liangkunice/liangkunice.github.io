## We gonna be happy for the rest of our lives ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹
![from the begining](http://ww2.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNc79ly1g4uomz8hvrj30d80jgjt9.jpg)



The story begins from on the date of 2017.9.3, maybe earlier, ~2017.8.

We love each other, though we have been through many conflicts. "Falling in love with you was the easiest thing I've ever done." It always bring a kind of sweetness every time I say good night to you, or give you a phone call. I believe we gonna love each other for the rest of our lives, we 100 percent count on each other, no matter what happens, cause no difficulty to spit us. 

Since I met you, I start to imagine a lot about our future. Although it won't be easy, but when feeling about you, I can spare no effort to overcome them. No matter how good or bad our life might be, what it matters is that we are going to stay and move on together, to share the sorrow and happiness, to see beautiful scenes and interesting people, to learn what we like, to walk, to play, and enjoy together.

Look at the path we've been through, it's so vivid and enjoyable. There is no end to the path, give me your hand, let's move on!
